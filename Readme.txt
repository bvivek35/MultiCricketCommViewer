A single page mashup of all commentary and score of all live cricket matches.

Features:
-- Real time updates from Cricinfo.
-- Uses Yahoo Query Language (YQL) web service to parse the live-matches-XML and individual-match-JSON. This renders the app almost completely serverless.

Usage:
-- Download the source. Just a few js files with an index.html.
-- Open index.html on the browser.
-- The app should be up if you have a working internet connection :-)
